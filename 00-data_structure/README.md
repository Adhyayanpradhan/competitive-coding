    As we all know the world is a computer program and we all are computer programs.<br>We already have attained Artificial General Intelligence with empathy 
    and wrapped as a disguise to project ourselves as combination of pixels which refelects as we see ourselves in the mirror.<br>
    As we are a program that constitutes of methodologies to help us fulfil our task and if we complete them we get rewards as a dopamine release in our brain.
    <br>This continues in a loop of task and reward just like the reinforcement learning. But underneath these sofisticated programs there is the core fundamentals 
    that has made our masters (the real human) achieving AGI by using <h4>Data structures and Algorithms.....</h4>
